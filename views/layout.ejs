          For demonstration purposes, the `title` is dynamically set here based on
          your `sails.config.appName` to show that you can inject data into layouts
          exactly the same way as with your other view templates.

        Stylesheets
        ========================

        You can link any CSS, LESS, or image files in your `assets` directory
        as you would normally: using <link/> tags.

        -->

        <!--

        Support for LESS included by default
        ================================================

        LESS files are automatically compiled when they change using the Gruntfile
        located in the top-level of this Sails app.  If you run into issues with styles
        not reloading, check the Sails log output in your console for LESS compilation errors.
        If necessary, shut down and then lift your app again.

        -->

        <!--STYLES-->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/linker/styles/main.css" />
        <!--STYLES END-->

        Another way: The Asset Linker
        ========================

        Sails supports a Grunt-based asset linker, to automatically inject 
        <link> and <script> tags, as well any client-side templates you're using
        into your HTML layouts and views, respecting dependencies.

        You created this Sails app with the asset linker disabled.
        If you change your mind, check out the docs on the subject:
